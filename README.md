# Reduce Background Flicker

Check it out on the [Chrome Web Store](https://goo.gl/HR5EhM).

Switching between dark pages on Chrome can sometimes lead to a blinding flash of white. This extension tries to preserve background color between page loads, if possible.

For the real Lords of Darkness out there, [setting a custom user stylesheet](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1373#c261) to your preferred color will probably be more effective than this extension. The same trick applies to Firefox.
